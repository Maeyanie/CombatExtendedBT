# Combat Extended: BackTrack Edition
Combat Extended: FastTrack Edition is a fork of the [original Combat Extended mod](https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/), with integrated support for more third-party mods and a more frequent update cycle.

Recently, the CE:FT team decided to update their binary version, which breaks C# mods which reference it. As I could not find a reasonable way to make mods compatible with both CE and CE:FT simultaneously, and strongly disagree with splitting the community by breaking the promised compatibility between the two, I decided to fork their fork to create a version which is still compatible. There are no other changes at this time.
Please do not bother them with bug reports which are specific to this version. At a very minimum, if you are reporting a bug to them, use the correct version (1.0.1.8) rather than any older one which might appear in your log file.

If CE:FT reverts their change or CE also updates their version number, this mod will cease to be updated. This exists only to improve compatibility, not create a [third competing variant.](https://xkcd.com/927/)


## Features
- Same [core features as the original mod](https://github.com/NoImageAvailable/CombatExtended/blob/master/README.md) - shooting, melee, armor, inventory and medical overhauls
- Fully compatible with existing CE savegames - delete CE completely, drop in CE:FT and go!
- 119 supported third-party mods (compared with 80 for CE)
- Recognizes existing third-party standalone patches intended for the original CE (Including C# ones)
- Additional ammo and projectile definitions and textures
- CE:FT-exclusive features for third-party modders and patch authors:
  - `ammoConsumedPerShotCount` for `Verb_ShootCE`, which supports guns with multiple simultaneous-firing barrels 
  - `Graphic_StackCountRanged` class, for precise control of item subgraphics based on stack count

## Incompatibilities
- **All Your Base**: Interferes with CE's modifications to base projectile definitions, and will prevent any CE weapons from firing

## Contributing Your Patches
- We welcome patches for any and all third-party mods!
- You can either submit a pull request, or just raise an issue to ask one of our regular contributors for help
- Our contributors will do our best to help optimize your patches and resolve any cross-compatibility issues
- If you are looking to add new ammo and projectiles, our resident artist will do any required textures in the official CE art style for free; again, just raise an issue and we can discuss your requirements from there

## Fork Policy
- CE:FT will be constantly updated to keep up with any new features, bugfixes and tweaks from the upstream CE project
- Each release will have the same version/tag number as the corresponding CE update, plus a FT-specific suffix (e.g. v1.0.1.5-FT-003 = base CE version v1.0.1.5 + FastTrack patch #3)
